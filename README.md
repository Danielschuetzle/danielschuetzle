# Hello World from neue Fische #

👋 Hi there! I'm Daniel, a 29-year-old software developer with a diverse background. Before diving into the world of programming in 2022, I spent several years honing my skills in sales. This unique combination of experiences has equipped me with a strong understanding of both the technical and interpersonal aspects of software development.

💻 I have gained proficiency in Vue 3, Ruby on Rails, and SQL, which are some of the key technologies I use in my projects. In my repositories, you'll find projects showcasing my coding skills and growth as a developer, particularly in these areas.

🌐 I'm always eager to learn, collaborate, and contribute to the tech community. Let's connect and create something amazing together!
